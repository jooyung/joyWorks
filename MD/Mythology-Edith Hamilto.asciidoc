== Preface

My aim has been nothing more ambitious than to keep distinct for the reader the very different writers from whom our knowledge of the myths comes.

My hope is that those who do not know the classics will gain in this way not only a knowledge of the myths, but some little idea of what the writers were like who told them -- who have been proved, by two thousand years and more, to be immortal.
