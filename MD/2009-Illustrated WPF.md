# 1. Introduction to Windows Presentation Foundation
## What Is Windows Presentation Foundation?
## The Path to the Screen
### Games and DirectX
[W] Since the significant effort required to use Direct3D generally outweighs its benefits in most consumer and business programming situations, the graphics power of video cards has remained largely `untapped`.
### Windows Forms
[W] locked in
> exhibiting total concentration on the task in hand

`Locked-in` implementation: Since the functionality and presentation of the UI elements is built into the operating system, there is little you can do to customize them, other than to build custom controls with the look and behavior you want. This severely limits the amount of original style you can include without investing in a fair amount of work
### Rendering Under WPF
## Documents and Fonts
## Graphics and Animation
[W] Animation refers to changing the display `in small ways` very quickly over time so that an object appears to move or change.
## Styles and Control Templates
[T] A **style** is a named set of property settings, much like Cascading Style Sheets styles in HTML or like paragraph styles in Microsoft Word.

## What Is an API?
## A Simple WPF Program
### Creating the Simple Program
[W] Use `whichever approach suits you best`, according to your experience and inclination.

[T] STAThread attribute: Single-Threaded Apartment model of threading
### Just the Facts
### Step-by-Step
## The Compilation Process
## The Application and Window Classes
## The Window Class
### The Components of a Visual Window
This area is also called the *window chrome*.
### Creating a Window
## Important Properties of a Window
The appearance of these items is controlled by five properties: *Title*, *Content*, *Foreground*, *Background*, and *WindowStyle*.

The *g* in the extension stands for *generated*.

Unless you look carefully, you might miss the *Connect* method in Windows1.g.cs. It's an explicit interface implementation, and its fully qualified name is *System.Windows.Markup.IComponentConnector.Connect*.

## Using Visual Studio to Create a WPF Program
### Step-by-Step
### Source Code Generated by the Template
## What Is XAML?
### Logical Trees and Visual Trees
## The Compilation Process
[T] BAML: Binary Application Markup Language
### How the Files Are Used
## The WPF Architecture
[T] MIL: Media Integration Layer

[W] The Medial Integration Layer is unmanaged code and maps the WPF constructs to DirctX. DirectX, in turn, maps them to the graphics card. This module is unmanaged code so that it can be `as efficient as possible`.
## More About the Window Class
A **brush** is a `graphic` that can be used to paint an area.

Each *brush type* paints with a different type of `graphic`.
### SolidColorBrushes
Notice that the objects returned by the properties are of type *SolidColorBrush* - not of type Color.
### Creating Colors
[W] When you combine them `in various proportions`, they produce different resulting colors.
### Gradient Brushes
### Linear Gradient Brushes
### RadialGradientBrushes
## The Application Class
## Handling Application Events
During an application's lifetime, it goes through various stages, such as *startup*, *activation*, *deactivation*, and *shutdown*.

## Markup Extensions
[W] `As useful as XAML is`, there are certain things it can't do on its own.

- A markup extension is a **hook** to a *class* outside the XAML.
- A class designed to be used by a markup extension is called an **extension class*.
### Example Creating a Markup Extension
[W] Creating one will also remove the mystery `that so often surrounds them`.
## White Space
**white space consolidation**

[W] For example, the following three button declarations have `varying` amounts and types of white space between the words Click and Me.

`<Button xml:space="preserve">눌러       주세   요</Button>`
## Special Characters
[T] **character entities**
These special strings are called <u>character entities</u>. All the *character entities* start with the ampersand character(<button>&</button>) and end with a semicolon.

Since the ampersand marks the start of a character entity, the ampersand character itself needs a character entity, in case you need to insert an actual ampersand character.
## Summary
# 5. Layout
## Layout in WPF
## Chapter Conventions
## The Layout Process
[W] As I mentioned, in previous frameworks, you set the size of an element and placed it on the panel, `and that was it`. It didn't move, and it didn't change size. Although that simplicity was nice, it also meant that the elements couldn't `adapt` as windows and panels changed size.
