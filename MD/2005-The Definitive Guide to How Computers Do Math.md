# Do You Speak Martian?
[W] tome (tōm)

- tome - a (usually) large and scholarly book
- <->book - a written work or composition that has been published (printed on pages bound together); *"I am reading a good book on economics"*

Sadly, however, it appears that the majority of these `tomes` are written by visitors from the planet Mars, whose keen understanding of higher mathematics is somewhat `offset` by their limited grasp of the English language.

[W] mull

- mull - reflect deeply on a subject; *"I mulled over the events of the afternoon"*; *"philosophers have speculated on the question of God for thousands of years"*; *"The scientist must stop to observe and start to excogitate"*
- =meditate, `mull over`, muse, ponder, chew over, think over, excogitate, reflect, ruminate, speculate, - contemplate
- <->cerebrate, cogitate, think - use or exercise the mind or one's power of reason in order to make inferences, - decisions, or arrive at a solution or judgments; *"I've been thinking all day and getting nowhere"*
- <->premeditate - think or reflect beforehand or in advance; *"I rarely premeditate, which is a mistake"*
- <->theologise, theologize - make theoretical speculations about theology or discuss theological subjects
- <->introspect - reflect on one's own thoughts and feelings
- <->bethink - consider or ponder something carefully; *"She bethought her of their predicament"*
- <->cogitate - consider carefully and deeply; reflect upon; turn over in one's mind
- wonder, question - place in doubt or express doubtful speculation; *"I wonder whether this was the right - thing to do"*; *"she wondered whether it would snow tonight"*
- <->puzzle - be uncertain about; think about without fully understanding or being able to decide; *"We puzzled - over her sudden departure"*
- <->consider, study - give careful consideration to; *"consider the possibility of moving"*

Much like reading *Being and Nothingness* by the famous French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, `one could mull over` many of these cryptic masterpieces until the end of time without gaining so much as the faintest clue as to what was in their authors’ minds.
# Why This Book Is So Cool
## Fearsome Warriors or Slaves to Fashion?
## This Book Is Cool Because . . .
[W] dollop (dŏl′əp)

- dollop - a small measure (usually of food)    
- <->small indefinite amount, small indefinite quantity - an indefinite quantity that is below average size or magnitude

Experts (the authors’ mothers in this case) agree that one of the best ways to learn something and remember it afterward is by means of hands-on experience, which you are poised to gain `in huge dollops` by using the virtual microcomputer/calculator that you’ll find on the CDROM accompanying this book.
## Jobs Abound for Time-Travelers
[W] yore (yôr)

- yore - time long past
past, past times, yesteryear - the time that has elapsed; *"forget the past"*

`In the days of yore`, when few people even knew how to count beyond the number of fingers on their hands, anyone who was capable of performing relatively rudimentary mathematical operations could easily achieve a position of power and standing in the community.

[W] vigesimal (vĭ-jĕs′ə-məl)

- relating to or based on the number twenty

Sometimes, fingers and toes in the case of societies that employed `vigesimal` (base-20) numbering systems.

[W] reckon with

- To take into account or deal with: a man to be reckoned with.

If you could predict and eclipse, for example, you wer obviously someone `to be reckoned with` (especially if it actually came to pass).
## Calculators Then and Now
[W] contraption (kən-trăp′shən)

- contraption - a device or control that is very useful for a particular job
- =gadget, appliance, contrivance, gismo, gizmo, widget, convenience
- <->device - an instrumentality invented for a particular purpose; *"the device is small enough to wear on your - wrist"*; *"a device intended to conserve water"*
- <->gadgetry - appliances collectively; *"laborsaving gadgetry"*
- <->gimbal - an appliance that allows an object (such as a ship's compass) to remain horizontal even as its - support tips
- <->injector - a contrivance for injecting (e.g., water into the boiler of a steam engine or particles into an - accelerator etc.)
- <->mod con - modern convenience; the appliances and conveniences characteristic of a modern house

[W] diluvian diluvial (dĭ-lo͞o′vē-əl) (-ən)

- diluvian - of or connected with a deluge
- =diluvial

In many cases, objects like this prompt speculation that our `antediluvian` ancestors were the creators of complex mechanical calculators with which they could perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## Déjà Vu (Didn’t Someone Just Say That?)
[W] déjà vu (dā′zhä vo͞o′)

- deja vu - the experience of thinking that a new situation had occurred before
- <->reminder - an experience that causes you to remember something

The **accuracy** and **precision** (as we will discover, these are two different things) required by an accountant and a rocket scientist may be `poles aprt`.

Well, we are in danger of finding ourselves in a `déjà vu` situation, because *knowledge is power*, and very few folks actually have any clue as to what is going on behind the scenes with regard to the way in which computers and calculators perform even simple operations.

[W] cool beans

- okay; a humorous and light-hearted nonsense phrase indicating approval or mild excitement
- wow; "that's remarkable" or "great"

The really **"cool beans"** part of all of this is the virtual microcomputer/calculator on the CD-ROM accompanying this book.
##Why Is this Chapter Numbered “0”?
[W] wend (wĕnd)

- wend - direct one's course or way; *"wend your way through the crowds"*
- <->go, locomote, move, travel - change location; move, travel, or proceed, also metaphorically; *"How fast does your new car go?"*; *"We travelled from Rome to Naples by bus"*; *"The policemen went from door to door looking for the suspect"*; *"The soldiers moved towards the city in an attempt to take it before night fell"*; *"news travelled fast"*

The reasons for this - and related conventions - will become apparent as we `wend our way through` the topics in this book.
# Introducing Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers
## Why Do We Need to Know this Stuff?
## Counting on Fingers and Toes
Thus, it is also no coincidence that the word **"calculate"** is derived from the Latin word for *pebble*.

[W] gross
In English and related languages, several terms involving the words "great" or "gross" (possibly, from French: grosse thick) relate to numbers involving *multiples of twelve (a dozen)*:

- A **gross** refers to a group of 144 items (a dozen dozen).
- A **great gross** refers to a group of 1728 items (a dozen gross).
- A **small gross** or a **great hundred** refers to a group of 120 items (ten dozen).
- A gross may be abbreviatied as "gr" or "gro".

This explains why we have special words like **dozen**, meaning "twelve", and **gross**, meaning "one hundred and forty-four" (12 x 12 = 144). The fact that we have 24 hours in a day (2 x 12) is also related to these base-12 systems.
## Place-Value Number Systems
Consider the concept of Roman numerals, in which I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500, M=1,000, and so forth.
